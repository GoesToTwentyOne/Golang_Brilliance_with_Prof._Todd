## Growing Mindset and Key Learnings:
### Why Go (Golang)?
- Utilize Multicore CPUs efficiently.
- Fastest growing and highly remunerative programming language.
- Developed by exceptional minds: Rob Pike, Ken Thompson, Robert Geriesemer.

### Success in Life:
- Embrace Grit and Perseverance, echoing Angela Lee Duckworth.
- Differentiate between a Growing Mindset and Fixed Mindset.

### Notable Quotes from My Teachers:
- "Begin with the End In Mind" - Setting goals.
- "Put First Things First" - Managing time effectively.
- "Success is the result of patience and persistence."
- "Drop by drop, the bucket gets filled."

### Essential Resources:
- [Go Forums](https://forum.golangbridge.org/)
- Official Documentation: 
  - golang spec
  - effective go
- Differentiating golang.org and godoc.org:
  - golang.org: Information about the language and standard library.
  - godoc.org: Covers standard library and third-party packages. [https://pkg.go.dev/]

### Development Environment:
- Tracing back to computer history with ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer).
- Command Line Interface (CLI) basics:
  - List of Directories: `ls`
  - Change Directory: `cd`
  - Create Directory: `mkdir {folder_name}`
  - Create File: `touch {file_name.extention}`
  - Edit File: `nano {file_name.extention}`
  - Read File: `cat {file_name.extention}`
  - Remove: `rm -rf {file_name.extention}`

### Environment Variables:
- System and User Variables.
- Essential Go Environment Variables: GOPATH, GOROOT, GOBIN, GOOS, GOARCH.
- Useful Go Commands: version, env, help, fmt, run, build.

### Go Modules (Package and Dependency Management):
- Go module: Efficient dependency management. Links: [https://golang.org/ref/mod], go blog - [https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules], [https://blog.golang.org/go116-module-changes]
- Upgrading and Adding Dependencies.
- Project Aristotle: [https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/]

### Miscellaneous:
- Golang Mascot: [Renne French - https://github.com/ashleymcnamara/gophers] [https://github.com/egonelbre/gophers]
- Entry point of a program: `func main` inside the `main` package.
- Package documentation structure.
- Exploring data types and underlaying types.

### Programming Fundamentals:
- Understanding computer functioning.
- Alan Turing's legacy and computer generations.
- Moore's law and popular coding scheme (UTF-8).
- Number systems: binary, decimal, octal, hexadecimal.
- Delving into constants, iota, bitshifting, and XOR operation.

### Control Flow:
- Extended Backusâ€“Naur form (EBNF) for grammar representation.
- For and conditional statements: if, else if, switch, select (using channels).
- In-depth study of various statements.

### Types in Go:
- Primitive data types: int, float, string, boolean.
- Composite data types: struct, pointers, functions, interfaces, array, slices, channels, maps.
- Scope of variables, import/export, zero values, fmt package verbs.
- Creating custom types.

### Functions and Methods:
- Functions as code reuse mechanisms.
- Varied function practices: variadic parameters, closures, recursion, etc.
- Method sets and interface implementation.
- Exploring structs and pointers.

### Applications:
- Working with JSON: marshaling, unmarshaling, encoding, decoding.

### Concurrency and Parallelism:
- Differentiating concurrency and parallelism.
- Handling concurrency with sync and waitgroup.
- Tackling race conditions with sync.Mutex and atomic package.

### Channels:
- In-depth study of channels: buffered, unbuffered, directional, fan-in, fan-out.

### Error Handling:
- Effective error handling strategies.

### Testing and Benchmarking:
- Comprehensive testing and benchmarking techniques.
