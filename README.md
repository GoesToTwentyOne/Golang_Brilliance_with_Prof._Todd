# Gwowing Mindset and Learning new things from this course :
- [x] **Why golang**
- Take advantage of Multicore CPU's.
- Fastest growing and highest paying programming language.
- Invented by 3 geniuses [Rob Pike,Ken Thompson,Robert Geriesemer].
- [x] **How to Succeed in Life?**
- Grit and Perseverance -- Angela Lee Duckworth
- Growing mind set and Fixed mindset Theory.
- [x] **Most liked and followed quotes of my teachers**
- Begin with the End In Mind {set goals}
- Put first think first {time on task}
- Persistently,patiently you are bound to succeed.
- Drop by drop  the bucket gets filled.
- [x] **Go Forums**
- https://forum.golangbridge.org/

- golang spec
- effective go
- [x] **golang.org vs godoc.org**
- golang.org [{About language},{Standard library}]
- godoc.org [{Standard library and Third party packages}]  -[https://pkg.go.dev/]

    - List and List all
        - ls -la
    - Change Directory 
        - cd 
    - Previous Directory
        - cd ../

        - mv {file_name.extention} {file_rename_name.extention}
    - Found something
        - {file_name.extention} | greb <found word or anything>
- [x] **Environment Variables**
- Variables that can be used across terminal commands are called environment variables.
    - [x] **Environment variable consists of 2 parts:-**
    - [x] **1. System variables:**
    - System environment variables are globally accessed by all users its means set for everyone.
    - [x] **2. User Variables:**
    - User environment variables are specific only to the currently logged-in user its means set for each user.
- Go Environment variables {go env}
    - GOPATH {Points to your go workspace}
    - GOROOT {Points to binary installation of golang files}

- Package management {Standard library and Third party package management}
- Entry point of a program { func main  inside of package main entry point of a program.}
- package documentation {like package fmt inside func Println()}
- Raw string literals vs Interpreted string literals.
- go keywords {golang reserve words. Use this certain/specific task to finished.Golang has 25 keywords}
- go operator {operator is a character that occured certain action.like: "4+4"--"+" an operator . It happens arithmatic logical operation add them 2 numbers. Go has 48 operators. }
- expression {In programming, an expression is a combination of one or more explicit values, constants, variables, operators, and functions that the programming language interprets and computes to produce another value. For example, 2+3 is an expression which evaluates to 5.}
- statements {In programming, expression is a standalone element of a program. A program is formed by a sequence of one or more statements.}
- Go is all about types.{Bill kennedy says type is life.}
    - [x] **Primitive data types**
    - It is a basic and build in type.

- {make,new,append,delete,copy,io writer,cap,len}
- [x] **Digging all types**
- explore {all data types}
- Underlaying data types.
- Type checking
- Golang is supports OOP concept.
- Everything in Go is PASS BY VALUE {go proverbs}

- function practices{veriadic parameter,unfluring,anonymous func(self executing func),func expression,returning a func,callback(higherorder func),clouser,recurtion}
- Method sets {most important quot"method set of a type determines the interfaces that the type implements"}
- Interface {polymorphism}
- struct {embeded type,anonymous struct,composite literal}
- [x] **Pointers**
- pointer {referencing,dereferencing,address pass to handle big program.}
- [x] **Applications**
- Application {Json,marshaling.unmarshaling,decode,encode}
- [x] **Concurreincy and Paralallielism**
- concurrency vs paralallelism {concurrency is a design pattern and paralallelism is simultatinously execute more than one goroutines ,if your computer has 1 CPU don't possible to paralallelism}.Two more valuable quote's {Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.} {Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.}
- handling concurrency {sync with waitgroup}
- Building race condition {dealing race condition with sync package mutex and atomic}
- [x] **Channels Digging**
- channels {communicate with diffirent goroutines,buffered,unbufferd,directional,bidirectional,fan-in,fan-out}
- [x] **Error handling**
- Error handling{log,Errors built-int,panic,recover}
- [x] **Testing and Benchmarking**
