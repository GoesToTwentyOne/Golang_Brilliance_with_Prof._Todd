# HonorableTodd_udemy_Golang_practice
# Preferred To anybody :
- [x] **My Learning and Review :**
- This course emphasis me to better skill gained. Really That was an awesome experienced, never been    before. Discuss about every tiny intermediate fundamental things. I really love this course and preferred this course to everyone who want to learn or skilled Google's Golang.
- [x] **Special Thanks to Califonia State University Professor Tood Mcleod**:
- I'm really grateful to Todd Mcleod because he gave me the coupon code for this course on Twitter.
- This course covered another most important topic How to Succeed in Life.
-                                                                   Regrads

# Gwowing Mindset and Learning new things from this course :
- [x] **Why golang**
- Take advantage of Multicore.
- Fastest growing and highest paying programming language.
- Invented by 3 geniuses [Rob Pike,Ken Thompson,Robert Geriesemer].
- [x] **How to Succeed in Life?**
- Grit and perseverance -- Angela Lee Duckworth
- Growing mind set and Fixed mindset Theory.
- [x] **Most liked and followed quotes of my teachers**
- Begin with the End In Mind {set goals}
- Put first think first {time on task}
- Persistently,patiently you are bound to succeed.
- Drop by drop  the bucket gets filled.
- [x] **Go Forums**
- https://forum.golangbridge.org/
- [x] **Official Documentation**
- golang spec
- effective go
- [x] **golang.org vs godoc.org**
- golang.org [{About language},{Standard library}]
- godoc.org [{Standard library and Third party packages}]  -[https://pkg.go.dev/]
- [x] **Development Environment**
- ENIAC(Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) computer history.
- Terminal{Text input/output environment}
    - [x] **MAC commands**
    - Print Working Directory
        - pwd
    - List of Directories 
        - ls
    - List and List all
        - ls -la
    - Change Directory 
        - cd 
    - Previous Directory
        - cd ../
    - Make Directory {folder}
        - mkdir {folder_name}
    - Make File
        - touch {file_name.extention}
    - Write file
        - nano {file_name.extention}
    - Read file
        - cat {file_name.extention}
    - Remove file or folder
        - rm -rf {file_name.extention}
- [x] **Environment Variables**
- Variables that can be used across terminal commands are called environment variables.
    - [x] **Environment variable consists of 2 parts:-**
    - [x] **1. System variables:**
    - System environment variables are globally accessed by all users its means set for everyone.
    - [x] **2. User Variables:**
    - User environment variables are specific only to the currently logged-in user its means set for each user.
- Go Environment variables {go env}
    - GOPATH {Points to your go workspace}
    - GOROOT {Points to binary installation of golang files}
    - GOBIN {Points to workspace binary}
    - GOOS {operating systems}
    - GOARCH {Go architecher}
- Go Commands {go [command] }
    - go version
    - go env
    - go help
    - go fmt
    - go run {file_name.extention}
    - go build
    - go help [ flag ]
- Go workspace
- IDE {Integrated Development Environment}
- Go module {dependencies management this is awesome features in golang}
- Upgrading dependencies
- Package management {Standard library and Third party package management}
- Entry point of a programm { func main  inside of package main entry point of a program.}
- package documentation {like package fmt inside func Println()}
- go keywords {golang reserve words. Use this certain/specific task to finished.Golang has 25 keywords}
- go operator {operator is a character that occured certain action.like: "4+4"--"+" an operator .It happens arithmatic logical operation add them 2 numbers.Go has 48 operator. }
- expression {in programming an expression is a combination of one or more explicit values, constants, variables, operators, and functions that the programming language interprets and computes to produce another value. For example, 2+3 is an expression which evaluates to 5.}
- statements {In programming expression is a standalone element of a program.A program is formed by a sequence of one or more statements.}
- Go is all about types.{Bill kennedy says type is life.}
    - [x] **Primitive data types**
    - It is a basic and build in type.
        - int
        - float
        - string
        - boolean
    - [x] **Composite/Aggregate/grouping data types**
    - aggregate of grouping differents data types
        - struct
        - pointers
        - functions
        - interfaces
        - array 
        - slices
        - channels
        - maps
- Scope of a variable {package level and function level}.
- Import and export of golang.
- zerro values.
- fmt package verbs.
- Create own type.
- [x] **Programming Fundamentals**
- How computer works
- Most popular coding scheme {UTF-8}
- Number system {binary,decimal,octal,hexadecimal}
- Digging all types 
- Constant,iota,bitshipting,xor operation
- [x] **Control flow**
- for statements { Condition | ForClause | RangeClause}
- conditional statements {if |else if | switch | select---{using channels handling}}
- Digging {return,go,break,continue,goto,fallthrough,deffer statements}
- {make,new,append,delete,copy,io writer,cap,len}
- [x] **Digging all types**
- explore {all data types}
- Underlaying data types.
- Type checking
- Golang is supports OOP concept.
- Everything in Go is PASS BY VALUE {go proverbs}
- Function {reuse code}
- function practices{veriadic parameter,unfluring,anonymous func(self executing func),func expression,returning a func,callback(higherorder func),clouser,recurtion}
- Method sets {most important quot"method set of a type determines the interfaces that the type implements"}
- Interface {polymorphism}
- struct {embeded type,anonymous struct,composite literal}
- [x] **Pointers**
- pointer {referencing,dereferencing,address pass to handle big value}
- [x] **Applications**
- Application {Json,marshaling.unmarshaling,decode,encode}
- [x] **Concurreincy and Paralallielism**
- concurrency vs paralallelism {concurrency is a design pattern and paralallelism is simultatinously execute more than one goroutines ,if your computer has 1 CPU don't possible to paralallelism}.Two more valuable quote's {Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.} {Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.}
- handling concurrency {sync with waitgroup}
- Building race condition {dealing race condition with sync package mutex and atomic}
- [x] **Channels Digging**
- channels {communicate with diffirent goroutines,buffered,unbufferd,directional,bidirectional,fan-in,fan-out}
- [x] **Error handling**
- Error handling{log,Errors built-int,panic,recover}
- [x] **Testing and Benchmarking**
- Testing & Benchmarking {table test,ExampleTestXxx,TestXxx,coverage,go vet{reports suspicious constructs},c.out file,html coverage view}
